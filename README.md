## This is unit 17 NoSQL homework: Fitness World Application

## Application URL

My code can be found at [Team Generator](https://sheldonmall.github.io/team-generator/) 

## Description

This is a CLI application that keeps track of workout details. It accepts workout details (resistance / cardio) and then shows the last workout details. It also shows a dashboard of workouts. 

The front-end was already provided and only server and routes had to be coded.

## Installation

* Please run `npm i express morgan mongoose` to install the dependancies before you execute this application.

## Usage 

Execute the application by giving the following command on the command line:
`$npm start`.

* The application will prompt to enter an `exercise` or to complete the `workout`. Selecting `exercise` will prompt to choose `Resistance` or `Cardio` type of workout. You will be required to enter information specific to each type of workout.

- Clicking the **Dashboard** link will show the workout statistics.
